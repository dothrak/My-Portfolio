# My Portfolio 🚀

Welcome to my personal portfolio built with React using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).I initially used Judygab's template as a starting point, available [here](https://github.com/judygab/web-dev-projects/tree/main/personal-portfolio), and added features as well as modified the layout to better suit my preferences.


## Technologies Used 🛠️

- Front-end library: [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- CSS framework: [React-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
- CSS animations library: [Animate.css](https://animate.style/)

## Features ✨

- Presentation of myself (my journey, projects and hobbies)
- My skills
- My various profiles on my hack platforms and my results at the ctf in which I took part
- Translation of my portfolio into three different languages (French, English, German)
